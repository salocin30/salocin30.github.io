summary: "<br>Hi ! I am Nicolas, Creative Technologist.<br><br>

I have a strong electronic and hardware background that I combine with software developpement and web technologies to cover all edges of technology. Sort of a fullstack maker.<br><br>

My field of expertiste is developping __custom software__ for the __Broadcast__ and __Pro AV__ industries. Those includes __Software Control Rooms__, __Audio and Video processing backends__, __Web Based Control Interfaces__. Some projects I've worked on :
<ul>
  <li>[RTBF - CR42 - award wining software control room project](/posts/software-control-room/rtbf-cr42)</li>
  <li>[European Broadcast Union - video compositing tool](/posts/software-control-room/ebu)</li>
  <li>[NATO - Conference Center Innovation](/posts/software-control-room/nato)</li>
</ul>
<br>On the side, I create projects that combine __light and sound__ and are often __portable and battery powered__. 
With the intent of being interactive, they offer unique experiences to their public. Some of them allow me to __host fun and entertaining events__. Have a look at some of them :<br><br>
