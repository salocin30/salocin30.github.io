## The need for portable power
Anything done on battery is instantly __cooler__. <br><br>
Watching a movie in your living room... dull ! Seeing a movie in a parc with a battery-powered cinema bike, magical ! (shoutout to [Cycle &toile](https://cycleettoile.org/) and Laurent Jourquin, check his project out)<br><br>
Attending a concert in a small venue, nice experience... but nothing special. Witnessing live music in remote nature, with portable PA and light installation ? Magical !<br><br>
Battery having the big adventage of beeing completly silent, unlike a gas generator.

All my projects are build from the start with battery operation in mind. They can obviously be powered by mains power as well.

## Ebike waste battery - a win-win approach

Let's face it, battery manufacturing is not the cleanest process on earth. Mining, refining and chemically processing the raw ore,... the ecological impact is big.<br><br>
How to minimize my personnal impact while meeting my battery needs ? By Re-using existing batteries !<br>
Ebikes have grown in popularity in the recent years and many "defective" batteries are available on the market. Just go ask around you or go check your local bike shop. They'll give them for free if you're nice.<br><br>
Batteries are made of two parts : individual cells (usually 40 per bike battery) and an electronic control board (the __bms__ or battery management system) that checks that each cell is not over or under charged. Most of the time, the only defective part is the bms. The cells are fine. To use the battery in a non-bike context, you can replace the bms with a generic one that cost less than $10 !

With half an hour of work and a new BMS, you can get 400Wh of power practically for free ! Economic and Planet Friendly. 

Bike batteries (li-ion) have many advantages:
- They have a voltage range of 30-42V. 
  - Less joule loss in cables while transfering power.
  - Can directly supply "mid power" audio amp (no boost converter) (~200W in 4 ohm)
- Much higher power density than Lead-acid (car) batteries
  - Batteries are lighter !

<br>

The average energy stored in an ebike battery is 400Wh. What can you do with that ?

- High level audio for 10 hours.
- Power a photobooth with a mini thermal printer for 6 hours.
- Heat up 4.3 liters of water from room temp to boiling?.

Clearly not my main use case but this highlight the fact that heating requires a LOT of energy.

## 1KwH li-ion battery

While scouting for batteries, I thought for a day that I had found a goldmine in a bike repair shop. ~50 defective VanMoof batteries ! More than 12KwH of energy storage. 
I took two home to test the cells and in the meantime, i was told they could not give them to me and had to ship them back to the supplier.
